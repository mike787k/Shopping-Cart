A shopping cart list is made; the list has a total of 5 items in which the items' id, name, and price are rendered onto the page

If the user inputs an id into the input field, the shopping cart will then re-render and will only show items with the matching id

The sum of the total price of all the items will also be rendered onto the page of the shopping cart
